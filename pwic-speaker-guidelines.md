# PWiC Speaker Guidelines

In addition to accepting the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pakistani-women-in-computing/pwic-documents/blob/master/pwic-code-of-conduct.md) for all attendees, speakers must agree to our rules for speaking. 
Failure to follow these rules will result in disqualification for speaking at PWiC events.

**Views expressed by speakers at PWiC events are their own and do not represent Pakistani Women in Computing (PWiC).**

## All Speakers

### Expected Behavior 
All speakers must register for PWiC event. 

- If you are unable to speak after confirming your participation, please let PWiC know as soon as possible at info@pwic.org.
- All speakers commit to presenting as scheduled by PWiC event's team.
- If you have a scheduling conflict for religious reasons, please reach out to us so we can accommodate you.
- Speakers must arrive to their assigned location 15 minutes before their session begins.
- Speakers must discuss the work for which they were selected to present. 
- Speakers may only hand out promotional materials and/or swag before, during, or after their session relevant to the session topic and your work.
- All material to be presented or distributed at the event should be submitted to the organizing team (team@pwic.org) 48 hours prior for vetting against PWiC code of conduct and other policies. PWiC team will use their discretion to allow any unvetted material to be shared at the event.

### Unacceptable Behavior 
- Speakers may not use their scheduled talk to promote irrelevant agendas.
